# SynPipe: Synthetic Object Pipeline for Hyper Suprime-Cam Data

The Subaru Strategy Survey Program (SSP) is an ambitious multiband imaging 
survey using the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC).  The HSC collaboration has developed 
sophisticated data reduction pipeline that will also be used by the Large 
Synoptic Survey Telescope.  Here we introduce the SynPipe: a flexible framework 
to test the performance of HSC pipeline using synthetic stellar and extedned 
objects.  Through injecting synthetic objects to images from individual 
exposures, SynPipe creates realistic coadd images and photometric measurements 
for them. In this work, we demonstrate the basic photometric performance of HSC 
pipeline using synthetic stars and galaxies close to the expected detection 
limit of SSP Wide survey.

SynPipe is also being used to test the selection of background galaxies for weak 
lensing analysis, the detection of high redshift dropouts, and photometry of 
low surface brightness objects.
